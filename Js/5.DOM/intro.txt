What is the DOM?
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a webpage as a hierarchical tree of objects. Each part of the webpage—HTML elements, attributes, text, etc.—is represented as a node in the tree, enabling programs like JavaScript to manipulate the content, structure, and styling of the document dynamically.

Key Features of the DOM
Tree Structure:

The DOM represents the HTML document as a tree where:
The root node is the <html> tag.
Child nodes are nested tags like <head>, <body>, etc.
Live Representation:

The DOM reflects real-time changes. If you add, delete, or modify elements using JavaScript, the DOM updates instantly.
Cross-Language Compatibility:

Though commonly used with JavaScript, the DOM can be accessed by other programming languages, like Python (e.g., with libraries such as BeautifulSoup).
Object-Oriented:

Every HTML element, attribute, or piece of text is represented as an object with methods and properties that allow manipulation.

Purpose of the DOM
The DOM allows JavaScript (or other scripts) to:

Read the structure and content of a webpage.
Modify the webpage's content, structure, and styling dynamically.
React to user actions (like clicks, typing, or scrolling).
Add Interactivity by enabling dynamic updates without reloading the page.


1. Selectors
document.getElementById('id'): Selects an element by its id.
document.querySelector('.class'): Selects the first element matching a CSS selector (e.g., .class, #id, tag).
document.querySelectorAll('tag'): Selects all elements matching a CSS selector, returns a NodeList (iterable).


Modifying Elements
1. Change Content
element.textContent: Updates the text content of an element (plain text only).
element.innerHTML: Updates the HTML content of an element (can include HTML tags).
2. Change Style
element.style.property: Modifies the CSS style property of an element.
